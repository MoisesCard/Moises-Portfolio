# Moises-Portfolio

In this project. I had to make a portfolio for myself with the help of html and css. I made a header, body and footer sections. I linked some text to show you what you are looking for. For example, My resume link would send you to a google doc page with my resume. Over-all this was a challenging but very informative way into creating a portfolio and will not be the last time I edit it.
